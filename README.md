## BirrWatch
BirrWatch is a web platform that consolidates foreign exchange rates from multiple Ethiopian banks, providing users with up-to-date and easily accessible currency information. The platform automatically scrapes exchange rate data from over 20 banks and displays the rates in a simple, user-friendly interface.
### Project Goal
BirrWatch aims to simplify the process of comparing exchange rates across different banks by collecting, storing, and displaying exchange rate data in a centralized location. Users can view current rates, track currency trends, and make informed decisions without having to manually visit each bankâ€™s website.

### Key Features
- Currency Comparison Table: Displays real-time exchange rates from various - banks side by side.  
- Interactive Graphs: Visualizes historical trends for currencies or compares rates between banks.  
- Automated Data Updates: Exchange rate data is refreshed automatically every few hours.  
- Responsive Design: The platform is mobile-friendly, providing a seamless experience across devices.  

### Technologies Used
Python: For web scraping and backend functionality.  
Flask: As the web framework for the backend and RESTful API.  
MySQL: To store the scraped exchange rate data.  
Alpine.js: For frontend interactivity.  
Bootstrap: For responsive and modern styling.  
Chart.js: To create interactive data visualizations.  

## API Documentation

This project includes an API for Getting exchange rates, scraping logs, and more. The API is built using **Flask** and **Flasgger** to automatically generate interactive Swagger documentation.

### Accessing the API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation via Swagger UI by visiting the following URL in your browser:  
[flask_url/apidocs](/apidocs)  

### Accessing and Testing the API

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation  
To interact with the API and test endpoints, visit the following URL:  

[http://localhost:5000/apidocs/](http://localhost:5000/apidocs/)

Once you're there, you can use the "Try it out" button on the Swagger UI to make requests to any of the endpoints directly from the documentation.
