    <h1>About BirrWatch</h1>
    <p>Welcome to BirrWatch, your comprehensive platform for tracking
            up-to-date exchange rates in Ethiopia. With recent changes in
            the countryâ€™s currency exchange market, each bank now sets 
            its own rates, which fluctuate constantly. BirrWatch aims to 
            bridge this gap by gathering and displaying these exchange
            rates in one easy-to-access place.</p>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>As the Ethiopian Birr shifted to a floating,
            market-driven rate, currency exchange rates 
            now vary significantly across different banks.
            BirrWatch was designed to provide users with 
            an accurate, real-time overview of these rates, 
            making it easier to find the best options for 
            currency exchange.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Display a complete table of exchange rates from 
            all applicable Ethiopian banks.</li>
        <li>Daily updates to ensure you have the latest
                currency rates without needing to check multiple sites.</li>
        <li>A graphing tool that lets you view historical
                rate changes for each currency or bank.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <p>BirrWatch is continuously evolving to meet user needs.
            Planned features include a more comprehensive data collection 
            mechanism, enhanced graphing options,
            custom alerts for significant rate changes, and
            expanded information on each currency and bank.
            We aim to grow BirrWatch into the go-to platform
                for real-time financial insights in Ethiopia.</p>
